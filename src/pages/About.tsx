            To create a thriving ecosystem where urban youth and farmers
            collaborate toward sustainable communities, reduce poverty, and
            drive agricultural innovation across Ethiopia. We envision a future
            where every young person has meaningful work and every farmer has
            the support they need to prosper.

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            YeLijoch Mahiber addresses two critical challenges in Ethiopia:
            youth unemployment in urban areas and the lack of agricultural
            support in rural communities. Our innovative model creates a bridge
            between these two worlds, empowering mutual benefit and sustainable
            impact.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through our structured 3â€“6 month field placement program, urban
            youth gain practical experience in agriculture while supporting
            smallholder farmers. This includes irrigation automation, modern
            planting techniques, weeding/harvesting, and market linkage
            facilitation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our approach is financially sustainable through multiple revenue
            streams including food distribution hubs, crop sales aggregation,
            farm productivity services, and job-placement services. We aim to
            place 5,000 youth annually while increasing income for farmers by
            30% within our target regions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Starting with pilot programs in Oromia, Amhara, and SNNPR regions,
            our plan is to scale across Ethiopia, creating a replicable model
            for rural-urban collaboration that can be adapted to other African
            contexts.
